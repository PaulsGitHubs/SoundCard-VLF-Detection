# Python Prototype - Automatic Radio Frequency Signal Classification with Local Data Base.
- We want it to be compatible and work simultaniously with multiple devices connected at once. Ideally 2-3 hackrfs, but we tried using 1 hackrf and 1 rtl sdr, because we could not get a 2nd hack rf.
- Fully Python with a PyQt interface
- Data base with signals (using just wikisignal for now). Would like to add a lot of natural and machine rf data as well as more signals for the classifcation model.
- Real time Signal Classifacation ML from IQ samples (Still working on)
- MultiBand monitoring (Implementing soon, will be capped based on device you use, will try to keep it open and scalable for different devices that can handle larger bandwidth).
- PSD Radio Scanner
- Optimizing for RLT and HACKRF
- Ideally Would like to be able to integrate the workflow of different machines in processing different bands (cloud computing) and use gpu.
